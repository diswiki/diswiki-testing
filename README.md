# Test Application of DisWiki.

DisWiki is still in active development.

### To-do
1. mockups (make a couple more for home page)
2. clean up code
3. clean up repo

- entire frontend
- user management
- admin panel
- auth & auth app
- actually posting to and updating wikis (server and user)
- whatever else that I can't think of right now
